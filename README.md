# UI/UX Community of Practice 

Welcome to the UI/UX Community of Practice. We are happy you are here! Please follow the steps below to get started:

## When we meet
Wednesday nights 6:00pm Pacific Time

## Let's get Started
If you haven't attended Hack for LA onboarding, please read the [Guide for New Volunteers](https://www.hackforla.org/getting-started), and register for an upcoming session.  

### Step 1. Join UI/UX Community of Practice
The first thing you should do after you've finished your Hack for LA onboarding is to join other UI/UX peeps in your community of practice   
- Join the [ui-ux](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C017ESHSMNG) Slack channel and introduce yourself by using the following text
``` 
Hi My name is _____ and I am looking forward to joining the UI/UX community of practice.  Here is my email address ___________.  Please add me to the drive.
```
- The Community of Practice leads will add you to the Google Drive [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1os-4KyGnL0SXIeyfoDICOEpG5CO_1MaV).
- Add yourself to the [Team Roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdfmQntbXnb2qK7qAWCAtzFi94ZTL8YTDkIwyuLm2_w/edit). Make sure you add your **NAME**, **Email Address**, **Slack Name**, and **GitHub Username**. 
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one. We use GitHub for everything!  
- Set up [two-factor authentication](https://www.hackforla.org/guide-pages/2FA.html) while waiting for the GitHub Admin to send you the invite (this can be completed after starting to attend meetings)
- After you have accepted the email invitation to our GitHub organization/repo, mark your Hack for LA membership [Public](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership#changing-the-visibility-of-your-organization-membership).

### Step 2. Get Familiarized with our Processes
We know you can't wait to meet everyone in the UI/UX commmunity, but before you join your first community of practice meeting, make sure you've checked the following list
- Read the [guide for using our Github Kanban boards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Fe7mNdmPBP5bD_yLJ1C0_I1TmoK47AuHHrdhdDyWCs/edit#heading=h.nl3p4nf4eqb4) (working draft) 
- All Hack for LA teams use Figma for our collaborative design. New to Figma? Learn more: [Figma for Beginners videos 1-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQ7IHkTiMM&ab_channel=Figma)  
- All Hack for LA teams generally work in an Agile framework. Read more about Agile and how it relates to Kanban [HERE](https://www.atlassian.com/agile).
- Check out the [open Design roles](https://github.com/hackforla/UI-UX/projects/3) and [open Research roles](https://github.com/hackforla/UI-UX/projects/2) we have available.
